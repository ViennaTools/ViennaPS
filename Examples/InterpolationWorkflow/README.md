# Interpolation Workflow

## Components

* __InterpolationWorkflow__: The main executable of this example project.
* __CreateData__: The executable used to create the _data.csv_ file.
* __GeometryReconstruction__: A simple example which first runs a physical deposition on a trench geometry. Afterwards the dimensions of the final geometry are extracted and subsequently used to geometrically reconstruct the trench geometry.
