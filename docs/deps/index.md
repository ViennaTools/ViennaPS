## [ViennaLS](https://github.com/ViennaTools/ViennaLS)

Handles topography simulation using an efficient level-set implementation based on a hierarchical run-length encoded (HRLE) data structure. ViennaLS also integrates the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) for geometry import/export, enabling processed geometries to be saved in the VTK format and visualized using ParaView.

<!-- ViennaLS forms the foundation of the process simulator, applying the level-set surface representation concepts for topography simulations. This module not only stores the level-set surface but also encompasses essential algorithms for geometry initialization, level-set value manipulation based on a velocity field, surface feature analysis, and seamless conversion of the level-set representation to other commonly employed material representations in device simulators. -->

## [ViennaCS](https://github.com/ViennaTools/ViennaCS)

Implements a cell-set representation to describe volumetric regions above and below the surface, extending ViennaPS’s capabilities beyond surface evolution.  

## [ViennaRay](https://github.com/ViennaTools/ViennaRay)

Provides a top-down Monte Carlo ray tracing approach for calculating fluxes on feature surfaces inside plasma processing chambers. Given the computational complexity of ray tracing, ViennaRay leverages high-performance external libraries for ray traversal and intersection calculations. It supports both CPU-based ray tracing via [Embree](https://www.embree.org/) and GPU-accelerated ray tracing via NVIDIA's [OptiX](https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/ray-tracing/optix), offering flexibility in simulation speed and accuracy.

<!-- ViennaPS relies on ViennaRay, a top-down Monte Carlo flux calculation library, to carry out essential flux calculations. This library is built upon Intel®'s ray tracing kernel, [Embree](https://www.embree.org/) for CPU ray tracing and uses NVIDIA's [OptiX](https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/ray-tracing/optix) for GPU ray tracing. -->
<!-- Crafted with a focus on efficiency and high-performance ray tracing, ViennaRay ensures a seamless user experience through its straightforward and user-friendly interface. -->

<!-- In the top-down Monte Carlo approach, a large number of pseudo-particles are launched from a source plane situated above the surface, and their points of impact on the surface are determined.
These pseudo-particles are initialized with a uniform initial position on the source plane and an initial direction that follows a power-cosine distribution. Each pseudo-particle carries a specific payload, representing a fraction of the total source flux. Upon reaching the surface, the current payload of the pseudo-particle contributes to the flux at that particular surface location.

Furthermore, pseudo-particles have the capability to undergo reflection from the surface. The payload of a pseudo-particle undergoes reduction by the sticking coefficient during reflection. As a result, a pseudo-particle is tracked until its payload falls below a certain threshold or until it exits the simulation domain. This tracking mechanism provides a comprehensive understanding of the particle dynamics during its interaction with the sample surface. -->

## [ViennaCore](https://github.com/ViennaTools/ViennaCore)

A utility library that provides common functionalities such as logging, vector operations, and other shared methods essential for all sub-libraries.
