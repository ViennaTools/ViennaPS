The IonBeamEtching model simulates anisotropic material removal by a directed ion beam, optionally including redeposition of sputtered material. It uses a physics-based yield function to compute the local etch rate as a function of incidence angle and ion energy, making it suitable for realistic simulation of focused or broad-beam ion etching setups. The process can be configured with: . | Mask materials – specified as a list of Material types that are excluded from etching. | IBE parameters – a complete set of physical and process-specific properties, such as ion energy distribution, sputter yield function, incidence angles, redeposition thresholds, and material-specific etch rates. | .

    "title": "SF6O2 Etching",
    "content": "#include &lt;psSF6O2Etching.hpp&gt; . The model for SF6O2 etching of silicon is based on a model by Belen et al. 1 and summarized here. For implementation details refer to here. To describe the feature scale simulation of SF6O2 plasma etching, the surface rates of both ions and neutral particles, specifically fluorine and oxygen, and the surface coverages of neutrals, are considered. Ray tracing is used for the calculation of the surface rates, which are used for calculating coverages during each time step. The etch rate is determined the three physical phenomena: . | Chemical etching | Physical sputtering | Ion-enhanced etching | . In the process of chemical etching, the fluorine from the SF6 species reacts with the exposed silicon surface. Physical sputtering is caused by high-energy ions impacting the surface. Due to an applied bias, ions strike the wafer surface with a high enough kinetic energy, $E_{ion} &gt; E_{th}$ to break the existing bonds in the silicon wafer or other exposed materials. Lastly, ion-enhanced etching, also known as reactive ion etching (RIE), combines the two previous effects. Since silicon surfaces that are saturated with fluorine are more prone to physical sputtering, the threshold energy for releasing the silicon atom $E_{th}$ is significantly reduced compared to non-fluorinated surfaces. Therefore, ion-enhanced etching provides an etch rate that is larger than the sum of the chemical etching and sputtering. The surface can be covered in fluorine or oxygen. The physical model keeps track of these coverages, given by $\\theta_F$ and $\\theta_O$, respectively, by calculating the flux-induced rates and considering the coverages from the previous time step. They are calculated with Langmuir–Hinshelwood-type surface site balance equations, given by: . \\begin{equation} \\sigma_{Si}\\cfrac{d\\theta_{F}}{dt}=\\beta_{F}\\Gamma_{F}\\left(1-\\theta_{F}-\\theta_{O}\\right)-k\\sigma_{Si}\\theta_{F}-2Y_{ie}\\Gamma_{i}\\theta_{F} \\label{equ:thetaF} \\end{equation} . \\begin{equation} \\sigma_{Si}\\cfrac{d\\theta_{O}}{dt}=\\beta_{O}\\Gamma_{O}\\left(1-\\theta_{F}-\\theta_{O}\\right)-\\beta\\sigma_{Si}\\theta_{O}-Y_{O}\\Gamma_{i}\\theta_{O} \\label{equ:thetaO} \\end{equation} . The term $\\sigma_{Si}$ represents the density of silicon at the surface point $\\vec{x}$ which is not included in the equations for legibility; $\\Gamma_F$, $\\Gamma_O$, and $\\Gamma_i$ are the emitted fluorine, oxygen, and ion fluxes, respectively; $\\beta_F$ and $\\beta_O$ are the sticking coefficients for fluorine and oxygen on a non-covered silicon substrate, respectively; $k$ is the chemical etch reaction rate constant; $\\beta$ is the oxygen recombination rate constant; and $Y_{ie}$ and $Y_O$ are the total ion-enhanced and oxygen etching yields, respectively. $Y_{ie}$ and $Y_O$ are yield functions that are dependent on the ion energies in the reactor. Since the surface movement is significantly smaller than the considered fluxes, it can be assumed that it does not impact the calculation. With this assumption of a pseudo-steady-state, the coverage equations can be set equal to zero, resulting in the following surface coverage equations: \\begin{equation} \\theta_{F}=\\left[1+\\left(\\cfrac{k\\sigma_{Si}+2Y_{ie}\\Gamma_{i}}{\\gamma_{F}\\Gamma_{F}}\\right)\\left(1+\\cfrac{\\gamma_{O}\\Gamma_{O}}{\\beta\\sigma_{Si}+Y_{O}\\Gamma_{i}}\\right)\\right]^{-1} \\end{equation} . \\begin{equation} \\theta_{O}=\\left[1+\\left(\\cfrac{\\beta\\sigma_{Si}+Y_{O}\\Gamma_{i}}{\\gamma_{O}\\Gamma_{O}}\\right)\\left(1+\\cfrac{\\gamma_{F}\\Gamma_{F}}{k\\sigma_{Si}+2Y_{ie}\\Gamma_{i}}\\right)\\right]^{-1} \\end{equation} . The reason that pseudo-steady-state can be assumed is that the incoming fluxes of all involved particles are in the order of 10$^{16}$–10$^{19}$ cm-1s-1, which is significantly larger than the surface etch rate ER, which is typically in the range of several nanometers per second. The oxygen particles do not take part in surface removal; instead, they occupy an area on the top surface layer and inhibit the effects of chemical etching by fluorine. Relating it to the parameters in the equation, the presence of oxygen (denoted by its flux $\\Gamma_{O}$) tends to reduce $\\theta_{F}$. Increasing the oxygen flux $\\Gamma_O$ increases the overall expression in the square brackets, which means $\\theta_{F}$ decreases. Since oxygen has a passivating effect, the etching of silicon proceeds only due to its reaction with fluorine and physical sputtering due to the incoming ion flux. At locations where oxygen coverage is high, only ion sputtering takes place. This brings us to the expression for the etch rate (ER), which is used to move the surface . \\begin{equation} \\textrm{ER}=\\cfrac{1}{\\rho_{Si}}\\left(\\cfrac{k\\sigma_{Si}\\theta_{F}}{4}+Y_{p}\\Gamma_{i}+Y_{ie}\\Gamma_{i}\\theta_{F}\\right), \\end{equation} where $\\rho_{Si}$ is the silicon density. The first, second, and third terms in the brackets of the etch rate equation represent the chemical etching, physical sputtering, and ion-enhanced etching, respectively. ",

    "title": "Ions",
    "content": "Each ion is endowed with an initial energy and direction upon creation on the source plane. The assignment of initial energies is governed by a normal distribution, characterized by a mean energy value and an energy sigma, thus allowing for stochastic variations in the initial energy states of the ions. The distribution of initial ion directions is given by a power cosine source distribution, which is defined by the exponent of the power cosine distribution. Upon impact with the surface, an energy- and angle-dependent yield is computed, which contributes to the specific surface point’s rate. The yield is expressed as: \\begin{equation} Y(E,\\theta) = A\\left(\\sqrt{E} - \\sqrt{E_{th}}\\right)f(\\theta), \\end{equation} where $E$ denotes the particle energy and $\\theta$ its incident angle. Here, $A$ represents a yield coefficient, and $E_{\\text{th}}$ denotes the material’s threshold energy for physical sputtering. The function $f(\\theta)$ characterizes the angle-dependence of the yield. For sputtering, the function is given by: \\begin{equation} f(\\theta) = (1 + B_{sp}(1-\\cos^2(\\theta)))\\cos(\\theta), \\end{equation} while for ion-enhanced etching, the function is given by: \\begin{equation} f(\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta). \\end{equation} . The ions can also reflect from the surface. Their energy loss during reflection is described by the model proposed by Belen et al 1. The current ray energy is multiplied by a factor $E_\\textrm{ref}$ ($0 \\leq E_\\textrm{ref} \\leq 1$) which depends on the incoming angle $\\theta$ in the following way: \\begin{equation} E_{\\textrm{ref}}= 1-(1-A)\\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\theta}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\theta_\\textrm{inflect}} \\quad \\text{ if } \\theta \\geqslant \\theta_\\textrm{inflect} \\end{equation} \\begin{equation} E_{\\textrm{ref}}=\\mathrm{A}\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_\\textrm{inflect}}\\right)^{n_l} \\quad \\text{ if } \\theta&lt;\\theta_\\textrm{inflect}, \\end{equation} where $A = (1 + n(\\frac{\\pi}{2 \\theta_\\textrm{inflect}} - 1))^{-1}$. Ions striking the surface at an angle denoted by $\\theta$ relative to the surface normal undergo reflection, where the angular dispersion is characterized by a cosine function centered around the direction of specular reflection defined by $\\theta_\\textrm{spec}$. This reflection process distinguishes between ions approaching the surface at glancing angles, which undergo nearly perfect specular reflection, and those striking the surface perpendicularly, which undergo nearly diffuse reflection. \\begin{equation} \\mathrm{P}(\\phi) \\propto \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\frac{\\phi}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\theta_\\textrm{spec}}\\right) \\quad \\text{ if } \\theta_\\textrm{inc} \\leqslant \\theta_\\textrm{min} \\end{equation} . \\begin{equation} \\mathrm{P}(\\phi) \\propto \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\frac{\\phi}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\theta_\\textrm{min}}\\right) \\quad \\text{ if } \\theta_{\\textrm{inc}}&gt;\\theta_{\\textrm{min}} \\end{equation} . The ray’s reflected direction is randomly chosen from a cone around the specular direction. The opening angle of this cone is given by the incidence angle $\\theta$. The ions sticking probability is described by two parameters $\\theta_\\textrm{Rmin}$ and $\\theta_\\textrm{Rmax}$: \\begin{equation} \\beta_{ion} = 1 \\quad \\text{ if }\\theta \\leq \\theta_\\textrm{Rmin} \\end{equation} \\begin{equation} \\beta_{ion} = 1 - \\frac{\\theta - \\theta_\\textrm{Rmin}}{\\theta_\\textrm{Rmax}- \\theta_\\textrm{Rmin}} \\quad \\text{ if }\\theta &gt; \\theta_\\textrm{Rmin} \\end{equation} .

    "title": "Fluorocarbon Etching",
    "content": "#include &lt;psFluorocarbonEtching.hpp&gt; . Our model assumes that, in any complex plasma etch process, there are three fundamental types of particles: etchant, depositing polymer particles and ions. Due to the long etch times, compared to surface reaction time scales, we can safely assume that each of these substances’ concentrations will reach a steady state on the surface. Therefore, the surface coverages of all involved particle types $\\phi_x$, where $x$ represents etchant (e), polymer (p), etchant on polymer (ep), and ions (i), are expressed by the following equations: \\begin{equation} \\frac{d \\phi_e}{dt}=J_{e} S_{e}\\left(1-\\phi_{e}-\\phi_{p}\\right)-k_{i e} J_{i} Y_{ie} \\phi_{e}-k_{e v} J_{e v} \\phi_{e} \\approx 0; \\end{equation} \\begin{equation} \\frac{d \\phi_{p}}{d t}=J_{p} S_{p}-J_{i} Y_{p} \\phi_{p} \\phi_{p e} \\approx 0; \\end{equation} \\begin{equation} \\frac{d \\phi_{p e}}{d t}=J_{e} S_{p e}\\left(1-\\phi_{p e}\\right)-J_{i} Y_{p} \\phi_{p e} \\approx 0. \\end{equation} Here, $J_x$ and $S_x$ represent the different particle fluxes and sticking probabilities, respectively. $Y_{ie}$ is the ion-enhanced etching yield for etchant particles, $Y_p$ is the ion-enhanced etching yield on polymer, $Y_{sp}$ gives the physical ion sputtering yield, and $k_{ie}$ and $k_{ev}$ are the stoichiometric factors for ion-enhanced etching and evaporation, respectively, which are determined by the chemical etching reaction. By solving these steady state equations for the coverages, one can determine etch or deposition rates on the surface. If deposition of polymer dominates, the surface normal velocity is positive and is given by \\begin{equation} v=\\frac{1}{\\rho_{p}}\\left(J_{p} S_{p}-Y_{p} J_{i} \\phi_{p e}\\right), \\end{equation} where $\\rho_p$ is the atomic polymer density. The first term $J_{p} S_{p}$ gives the rate of polymer particles reaching and adsorbing on the surface, while the second term $Y_{p} J_{i} \\phi_{p e}$ describes the removal of polymer by ion-enhanced etching. Together, these terms describe the deposition of polymer material on the surface, which acts as passivation layer for the chemical etching process. If, on the other hand, etching of the substrate dominates, the negative surface velocity of the substrate is given by \\begin{equation} v=\\frac{1}{\\rho_{m}}\\left[J_{e v} \\phi_{e}+J_{i} Y_{ie} \\phi_{e}+J_{i} Y_{sp}\\left(1-\\phi_{e}\\right)\\right], \\end{equation} where $\\rho_m$ is the atomic density of the etched material and depends on which layer in the stack is being etched. Each term accounts for a different type of surface reaction. The first term, $J_{e v} \\phi_{e}$, describes the chemical etching process, where etchants bind chemically with the substrate to form volatile etch products which dissolve thermally from the surface. Thus, the evaporation flux $J_{ev}$ is a parameter proportional to the etchant flux $J_e$ and depends on the chemical gas and surface composition and temperature of the etching plasma. It is given by \\begin{equation} J_{ev} = K e^{-E_a/k_B T}J_e, \\end{equation} where $K$ is a process parameter describing the volatility of the chemical etching process, $E_a$ is the activation energy for thermal etching, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature. The second term, $J_{i} Y_{ie} \\phi_{e}$, describes the contribution of ion-enhanced etching. In this surface reaction, volatile etch products which do not dissolve from the surface thermally, absorb energy from impinging ions and consequently dissolve from the surface. Finally, the last term, $J_{i} Y_{sp}\\left(1-\\phi_{e}\\right)$, describes physical sputtering of the substrate by highly energetic ions. Since both chemical and ion-enhanced etching involve etchants, they are proportional to the etchant coverage $\\phi_e$, while physical ion sputtering takes place directly on the substrate and is thus proportional to the fraction of the surface not covered by the etchant.

    "title": "Ions",
    "content": "Each ion is endowed with an initial energy and direction upon creation on the source plane. The assignment of initial energies is governed by a normal distribution, characterized by a mean energy value and an energy sigma, thus allowing for stochastic variations in the initial energy states of the ions. The distribution of initial ion directions is given by a power cosine source distribution, which is defined by the exponent of the power cosine distribution. Upon impact with the surface, an energy- and angle-dependent yield is computed, which contributes to the specific surface point’s rate. The yield is expressed as: \\begin{equation} Y(E,\\theta) = A\\left(\\sqrt{E} - \\sqrt{E_{th}}\\right)f(\\theta), \\end{equation} where $E$ denotes the particle energy and $\\theta$ its incident angle. Here, $A$ represents a yield coefficient, and $E_{\\text{th}}$ denotes the material’s threshold energy for physical sputtering. The function $f(\\theta)$, which characterizes the angle-dependence of the yield. For sputtering, the function is given by: \\begin{equation} f(\\theta) = (1 + B_{sp}(1-\\cos^2(\\theta)))\\cos(\\theta), \\end{equation} while for ion-enhanced etching, the function is given by: \\begin{equation} f(\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta). \\end{equation} . The ions can also reflect from the surface. Their energy loss during reflection is described by the model proposed by Belen et al [^1]. The current ray energy is multiplied by a factor $E_\\textrm{ref}$ ($0 \\leq E_\\textrm{ref} \\leq 1$) which depends on the incoming angle $\\theta$ in the following way: \\begin{equation} E_{\\textrm{ref}}= 1-(1-A)\\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\theta}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\theta_\\textrm{inflect}} \\quad \\text{ if } \\theta \\geqslant \\theta_\\textrm{inflect} \\end{equation} \\begin{equation} E_{\\textrm{ref}}=\\mathrm{A}\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_\\textrm{inflect}}\\right)^{n_l} \\quad \\text{ if } \\theta&lt;\\theta_\\textrm{inflect}, \\end{equation} where $A = (1 + n(\\frac{\\pi}{2 \\theta_\\textrm{inflect}} - 1))^{-1}$. Ions striking the surface at an angle denoted by $\\theta$ relative to the surface normal undergo reflection, where the angular dispersion is characterized by a cosine function centered around the direction of specular reflection defined by $\\theta_\\textrm{spec}$. This reflection process distinguishes between ions approaching the surface at glancing angles, which undergo nearly perfect specular reflection, and those striking the surface perpendicularly, which undergo nearly diffuse reflection. \\begin{equation} \\mathrm{P}(\\phi) \\propto \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\frac{\\phi}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\theta_\\textrm{spec}}\\right) \\quad \\text{ if } \\theta_\\textrm{inc} \\leqslant \\theta_\\textrm{min} \\end{equation} . \\begin{equation} \\mathrm{P}(\\phi) \\propto \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\frac{\\phi}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\theta_\\textrm{min}}\\right) \\quad \\text{ if } \\theta_{\\textrm{inc}}&gt;\\theta_{\\textrm{min}} \\end{equation} . The ray’s reflected direction is randomly chosen from a cone around the specular direction. The opening angle of this cone is given by the incidence angle $\\theta$. ",

It’s important to note that ViennaPS focuses on handling simple geometry information extracted from GDSII files, without supporting additional data that might be stored within the GDSII format. To parse a GDSII file using ViennaPS, follow these steps: . | Create a ps::GDSGeometry Object: Initialize a ps::GDSGeometry object, specifying the desired grid spacing, boundary conditions, and additional padding (optional). auto mask = ps::SmartPointer&lt;ps::GDSGeometry&lt;NumericType, D&gt;&gt;::New(); mask-&gt;setGridDelta(gridDelta); mask-&gt;setBoundaryConditions(boundaryConds); mask-&gt;setBoundaryPadding(xPad, yPad); . Replace gridDelta, boundaryConds, and xPad,yPad with your preferred values. The geometry is always parsed on a plane normal to the z direction. The values of xPad and yPad are always added to the largest and subtracted from the smallest extension of all geometries in the GDSII file. | Use ps::GDSReader to Parse Geometry: Utilize the ps::GDSReader to parse the GDSII file into the previously created ps::GDSGeometry object. ps::GDSReader&lt;NumericType, D&gt;(mask, \"path/to/your/file.gds\").apply(); . Replace \"path/to/your/file.gds\" with the actual path to your GDSII file. | Convert Single Layers to Level Sets: Extract specific layers from the parsed GDSII geometry, convert them into level sets, and add them to your simulation domain.

    "content": "#include &lt;psGeometricDistributionModels.hpp&gt; . Geometric models apply purely geometric transformations to the surface, independent of any particle fluxes or surface chemistry. They are typically used to quickly emulate processes such as isotropic or anisotropic etching and deposition. Each geometric model is defined by a surface distribution function, which specifies how the processed surface is constructed. For instance, an isotropic deposition model uses a spherical distribution of constant radius: a sphere is centered at every surface point, and the outermost envelope of all spheres forms the new surface after deposition. Anisotropic behavior can be introduced by using non-spherical or directional distributions, such as box-shaped or custom-defined ones. ViennaPS provides three ready-to-use geometric distributions: . | SphereDistribution — for isotropic processes | BoxDistribution — for directional or anisotropic processes | CustomSphereDistribution — for user-defined spherical variants | . These models can be applied directly as ProcessModelCPU objects within a Process. Sphere Distribution . Creates an isotropic geometric model using spherical envelopes of constant radius. Each surface point is expanded into a sphere of radius r, and the new surface is formed by the outermost boundary of all spheres. Constructor: . SphereDistribution(NumericType radius, LSPtr mask = nullptr) . Parameters: . | Name | Type | Description | . | radius | NumericType | Radius of the spherical distribution (controls isotropic expansion or shrinkage). | . | mask | SmartPointer&lt;viennals::Domain&lt;NumericType, D&gt;&gt; (optional) | Optional mask layer that restricts the process to specific regions. | . Box Distribution . Creates an anisotropic geometric model based on box-shaped envelopes. Each surface point is expanded by a rectangular box defined by its half-axis lengths, allowing directional or anisotropic effects. Constructor: . BoxDistribution(const std::array&lt;viennahrle::CoordType, 3&gt; &amp;halfAxes, LSPtr mask = nullptr) . Parameters: . | Name | Type | Description | . | halfAxes | std::array&lt;double, 3&gt; | Half-axis lengths of the box distribution in x, y, and z directions. | . | mask | SmartPointer&lt;viennals::Domain&lt;NumericType, D&gt;&gt; (optional) | Optional mask layer to confine processing. | . Custom Sphere Distribution . Defines a custom isotropic model where the radius of the spherical distribution varies for each surface point. Each surface point uses the corresponding radius from the provided list. Surface points can be extracted by using the ToDiskMesh utility. Constructor: . CustomSphereDistribution(const std::vector&lt;NumericType&gt; &amp;radii, LSPtr mask = nullptr) . Parameters: . | Name | Type | Description | . | radii | std::vector&lt;NumericType&gt; | List of radii for each surface point. | . | mask | SmartPointer&lt;viennals::Domain&lt;NumericType, D&gt;&gt; (optional) | Optional mask restricting which surface regions are processed. | . Each of these models can be used as input to a Process object: . auto model = SmartPointer&lt;SphereDistribution&lt;double, 3&gt;&gt;(1.0); Process(domain, model, time).apply(); . ",

For example: . ps::Domain&lt;double, 3&gt; domain3D; // 3D simulation ps::Domain&lt;double, 2&gt; domain2D; // 2D simulation . Because the dimensionality is a compile-time parameter, 2D and 3D classes cannot be mixed within the same simulation. Once chosen, the dimensionality remains fixed for all components of that simulation. For users who need to transition from a 2D to a 3D simulation, ViennaPS offers the Extrude utility. This utility enables the extrusion of a 2D domain to 3D, providing a seamless way to extend simulations across different dimensions. In the Python bindings, the simulation dimensionality is organized into two dedicated modules: d2 for 2D and d3 for 3D simulations. Users can choose the appropriate module depending on their needs. By default, ViennaPS operates in 2D mode. To switch to 3D, call: . ps.setDimension(3) .

Each particle can have custom energy, angular, and sticking characteristics. | AdvectionCallback — Optional callback function that allows executing custom operations before or after the level-set advection step (e.g., data logging, post-processing). | GeometricModel — Used for purely geometric transformations without particle fluxes or chemistry (e.g., isotropic deposition, anisotropic etching). | . Custom model building is available only in the C++ interface. ",

The source exponent defines the distribution of the initial directions of the ions. A source exponent of 1 means that the ions are emitted isotropically, while a source exponent of 1000 means that the ions are emitted mostly perpendicular to the surface. The ion sticking function is defined by the parameters $\\theta_{min}$ and $\\theta_{max}$. The ion sticking function is a function of the incoming angle $\\theta$ that defines the probability that an ion will stick to the surface upon impact. The ion sticking function is a linear function defined as: . \\[S(\\theta) = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if } \\theta &lt; \\theta_{min} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{if } \\theta &gt; \\theta_{max} \\\\ \\frac{\\theta_{max} - \\theta}{\\theta_{max} - \\theta_{min}} &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\\] Ions striking the surface at an angle denoted by $\\theta$ relative to the surface normal undergo reflection, where the angular dispersion is characterized by a cosine function centered around the direction of specular reflection defined by $\\theta_\\textrm{spec}$. This reflection process distinguishes between ions approaching the surface at glancing angles, which undergo nearly perfect specular reflection, and those striking the surface perpendicularly, which undergo nearly diffuse reflection. The ray’s reflected direction is randomly chosen from a cone around the specular direction. The opening angle of this cone is given by the incidence angle $\\theta$ or the minimum specified angle $\\theta_{min}$. Optional Parameters: . Ion can be assigned an energy which can be used to calculate a surface yield. This feature can be activated by setting the mean energy &gt; 0 and is deactivated by setting the mean energy = 0. The energy distribution of the ions is assumed to be Gaussian with a standard deviation of sigmaEnergy. The threshold energy is the energy below which the ion will not sputter the surface, and the energy dependent yield is defined as: . \\[Y(E) = \\begin{cases} 0 &amp; \\text{if } E &lt; E_{\\textrm{threshold}} \\\\ \\sqrt{E} - \\sqrt{E_{\\textrm{threshold}}} &amp; \\text{if } E \\geq E_{\\textrm{threshold}} \\end{cases}\\] The inflection angle and n are parameters of the ion energy reduction function, which is used to calculate the energy after reflection.

ViennaPS integrates advanced ray tracing techniques, leveraging the power of the ViennaRay library based on Intel®’s Embree ray tracing kernel, into the realm of process simulations. This combination enables precise and efficient flux calculations within topography simulations. This process includes launching rays from a source and tracing their paths as they interact with the surface geometry. Ray tracing allows for the simulation of complex phenomena such as shadows, reflections, and transmission of energy through transparent materials. ViennaPS integrates ViennaRay functionality through the viennaray::Particle class, providing users with a versatile interface to define the key characteristics of the simulated particle species and tailor their behavior upon surface interactions, including reflective properties. Within the particle class, users can fine-tune parameters governing the initial state of particles, enabling precise control over their interactions with material surfaces. For an in-depth understanding of the viennaray::Particle class and its functionalities, users are encouraged to refer to the detailed documentation available within the ViennaRay documentation. Within ViennaPS, a process model has the flexibility to encompass multiple particle species, each contributing distinct characteristics to the simulation. The fluxes computed from these particles are conveniently accessible through the SurfaceModel class. This interface allows users to seamlessly integrate the particle flux data into a physical model, facilitating the simulation of intricate physical processes. By leveraging the calculated fluxes within the surface model, users can construct comprehensive simulations that capture the nuanced interplay of particles and materials, offering a robust framework for exploring diverse scenarios in process simulation.

The process is specified by the rate, the particle sticking coefficient, and the exponent in the power cosine distribution of the initial particle directions. The rate can be either negative or positive, corresponding to etching or deposition, respectively. The sticking coefficient is the probability that a particle will stick to the surface upon impact, thus controlling the number of diffusive reflections from the surface. The exponent in the power cosine distribution of the initial particle directions is a measure of the angular spread of the initial particle directions. A higher exponent corresponds to a more focused beam of particles.

This function is obtained using signed distance transforms, describing the surface $S$ as the zero LS: . \\[S = \\{\\vec{x}\\!: \\, \\phi(\\vec{x}) = 0 \\}.\\] If the domain contains multiple LSs, the top LS wraps the entire structure and therefore represents the surface, while all other LS functions just describe material interfaces. Formally, the different material regions can be described by ${M}$ LS functions satisfying . \\[\\Phi_k(\\vec{x}) \\leq 0 \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad \\vec{x} \\in \\bigcup_{i=1}^k \\mathcal{M}_i.\\] Here $\\Phi_M$ describes the entire structure $\\mathcal{M}$, and the other LS functions correspond to material interfaces. When inserting a new LS into the domain, an automatic wrapping process ensues. This process involves enveloping all existing Level-Sets through a Boolean operation, specifically a union with the topmost LS. It’s worth noting, though, that this default behavior is not obligatory. In instances where a specialized domain structure is desired, users have the option to circumvent this automatic wrapping mechanism. ",

    "content": ". | The SurfaceModel class is used to describe surface reactions, combining particle fluxes with the surface chemical reactions. | The velocities used for surface advection in a time step are calculated through the calculateVelocities() function. | Surface coverages can be used to track the coverage a chemical species on the surface through a time step. | The coverages can be initialized to equilibrium by iteratively calculating the fluxes on the surface and updating the coverages. The number of iterations to initialize the coverages can be specified through the Process. | Coverages and fluxes are stored as viennals::PointData. | . The SurfaceModel class serves as a comprehensive framework for detailing surface chemistries. Users have the flexibility to create a customized child class where they can precisely dictate how surface coverages evolve, driven by the rates at which particles impact the surface. One key feature is the capability to monitor surface coverages, providing insights into the presence of chemical species on the surface throughout a simulation’s time step. To initialize the coverage data vector, the method initializeCoverages() is employed. void initializeCoverages(unsigned numSurfacePoints) override { // a single set of coverages is initialized here std::vector&lt;NumericType&gt; someCoverage(numSurfacePoints, 0); coverages = ps::SmartPointer&lt;viennals::PointData&lt;NumericType&gt;&gt;::New(); coverages-&gt;insertNextScalarData(someCoverage, \"someCoverage\"); } . To use coverages, it is essential to initialize the class member coverages with a new instance of viennals::PointData. If the coverages variable is left as nullptr, no coverages will be utilized during the simulation. To initialize a single coverage, a container with a size equal to the number of surface points must be created and inserted into the viennals::PointData. Additionally, a name for the coverage can be specified during initialization. This designated name should then be used in updateCoverages() or calculateVelocities() to access the specific coverage as needed. To ensure accurate representations, coverages can be initialized to equilibrium by iteratively calculating surface fluxes and updating coverages. The initialization process’s iteration count is customizable through the Process interface. The method updateCoverages() encapsulates the user-defined description of surface coverage evolution in each iteration. Since coverages is a member of the psSurfaceModel class, it can be accessed in every member function. void updateCoverages(ps::SmartPointer&lt;viennals::PointData&lt;NumericType&gt;&gt; particleFluxes, const std::vector&lt;NumericType&gt; &amp;materialIds) override { auto myCoverage = coverages-&gt;getScalarData(\"someCoverage\"); // update coverage from calculated fluxes } . Within the psSurfaceModel class, the method calculateVelocities() utilizes fluxes obtained through ray tracing, to provide the velocities used for surface advection in a time step. Here the fluxes from particle, as well as previously calculated coverages can be accessed and combined to yield the final velocity at each surface point. The function should return a SmartPointer to a new vector, containing the velocity at each surface point. In order to create a custom surface the user has to interface the SurfaceModel class. An example implementation of a custom surface model is given below: . template &lt;typename NumericType&gt; class myCustomSurfaceModel : public ps::SurfaceModel&lt;NumericType&gt; { public: using ps::SurfaceModel&lt;NumericType&gt;::coverages; // needed to access coverages void initializeCoverages(unsigned numSurfacePoints) override { // a single set of coverages is initialized here std::vector&lt;NumericType&gt; someCoverage(numSurfacePoints, 0); coverages = ps::SmartPointer&lt;viennals::PointData&lt;NumericType&gt;&gt;::New(); coverages-&gt;insertNextScalarData(someCoverage, \"someCoverage\"); } void updateCoverages(ps::SmartPointer&lt;viennals::PointData&lt;NumericType&gt;&gt; particleFluxes, const std::vector&lt;NumericType&gt; &amp;materialIds) override { auto myCoverage = coverages-&gt;getScalarData(\"someCoverage\"); // update coverage from calculated fluxes } ps::SmartPointer&lt;std::vector&lt;NumericType&gt;&gt; calculateVelocities( ps::SmartPointer&lt;viennals::PointData&lt;NumericType&gt;&gt; rates, const std::vector&lt;std::array&lt;NumericType, 3&gt;&gt; &amp;coordinates, const std::vector&lt;NumericType&gt; &amp;materialIds) override { // use coverages and rates here to calculate the velocity here return ps::SmartPointer&lt;std::vector&lt;NumericType&gt;&gt;::New( *rates-&gt;getScalarData(\"particleRate\")); } }; .

The CS is stored over the whole simulation domain, above and/or below the surface described by the Level-Set. It uses the same grid as the Level-Set, such that each Level-Set grid point acts as the corner of the cells around the point. To determine which material region a cell lies in, the LS values at the cell corner of the material interface are inspected. If the sum of the values is negative the cell belongs to the underlying material, otherwise it represents the material on the other side of the interface. To find a cell in which an arbitrary point in space resides, a bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) is built on top of the CS. This allows for fast access to random cells in the CS. Additionally, cell-neighbor relations are established when setting up the CS. This allows for quick access to neighbor cells. ",

The WetEtching model simulates crystal-orientation–dependent etching processes, commonly used to describe anisotropic wet chemical etching of crystalline materials (e.g., KOH etching of silicon). The etch rate depends on the orientation of the local surface normal with respect to the crystal directions {100}, {110}, {111}, and {311}. For each allowed etching material, orientation-specific rates can be specified, enabling accurate modeling of material-selective and anisotropic etching behaviors. Two constructor variants are provided: . | Simple mode – specify only the materials to be etched and their global rates; default crystal directions and rates for each orientation are used. | Advanced mode – specify custom crystal direction vectors and per-orientation rates, along with the etching materials. | . During simulation: . | The local surface normal is compared to the crystal orientation vectors. | The velocity field is computed analytically from the given orientation-dependent rates. | Only materials specified in the materials list are etched; others are unaffected. | .
